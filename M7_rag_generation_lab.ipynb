    "In this lab, you'll take on the role of a junior data scientist at a healthcare technology company that specializes in creating educational resources for patients. Your team has been tasked with developing a system that can automatically generate informative responses to common patient questions about medical conditions, treatments, and wellness practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to ensure these responses are both accurate and grounded in authoritative medical information. Your specific assignment is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can:\n",
    "1. Understand patient questions about various health topics\n",
    "2. Retrieve relevant information from a trusted knowledge base\n",
    "3. Generate helpful, accurate responses based on that information\n",
    "4. Avoid \"hallucinated\" content that could potentially misinform patients\n",
